# Business Verification Service
This C# ASP.NET Core Web API is my contribution to an education group project. It makes use of xUnit Test, NuGet Packages, Firebase tools, MailerSend and Docker.
The main focus of the project is a mobile app made with Flutter/Dart. It uses Firebase and a few services writen in C#, Java and Python as its backend, and Firestore as its database.
I also did the integration of this service with the Flutter app and Firebase.
